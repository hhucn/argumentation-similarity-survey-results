        <h3>Question Ap </h3>
        <p>Alice has the following attitudes on nuclear power, compulsory vaccination, genetic engineering and universal basic income:</p>
        <p>&gt; I am **for** nuclear power because it is **sustainable**. I **do not** think that nuclear power plants are **safe**.</p>
        <p>&gt; I am **for** the introduction of compulsory vaccination because it **reduces the frequency of diseases**. I **do not** think that **less medication** would be needed.</p>
        <p>&gt; I am **for** planting genetically modified crops because this **increases the availability of food**. I **do not** think that this will make food **cheaper**.</p>
        <p>&gt; I am **for** a universal basic income, because it is **less bureaucratic** than the existing social system. I **do not** think that it reduces the **crime rate**.</p>
